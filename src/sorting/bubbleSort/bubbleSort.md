# Bubble Sort

### Description
Typical first one to do because it matches the human mental model of sorting
Compare to items next to each other in an array and swap them if necessary

### BigO
* best case    : O(n) => Linear time
* worst case   : O(n2) => Quadratic time
* average case : O(n2) => Quadratic time

### Spatial complexity: O(1)
We're operating on the array itself not creating anything else in memory


# Improved Bubble Sort

### Description:
This one is similar to the bubble sort algorithm
but we subtract the number of passes from the inner loop
to avoid all the ending useless comparisons

### BigO
* best case    : O(n2) => Linear time
* worst case   : O(n2) => Quadratic time
* average case : O(n2) => Quadratic time

### Spatial complexity: O(1)
We're operating on the array itself not creating anything else in memory
