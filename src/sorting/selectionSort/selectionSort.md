# Selection Sort

### Description:
It is an in-place comparison sort algorithm.
The idea is to find the minimal value and place it in the first position
Then find the second minimum value and place it second, and so on...

### BigO
* best case    : O(n2) => Linear time
* worst case   : O(n2) => Quadratic time
* average case : O(n2) => Quadratic time

### Spatial complexity: O(1)
We're operating on the array itself not creating anything else in memory
