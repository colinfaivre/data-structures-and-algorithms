# Merge Sort

### Description
This is a divide and conquer algorithm. The idea behind is to divide the original aray into smaller arrays until each small array has only one position, and then merge these smaller arrays into bigger ones until we have a single big aray at the end that is sorted. Mozilla Firefox uses merge sort for the Array.prototype.sort method but Chrome uses a variation of the quick sort algorithm
