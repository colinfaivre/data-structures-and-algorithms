# Insertion Sort

### Description
It builds the final array one value at a time
It assumes that the first element is already sorted
Then a comparison with the second value is performed
Should the second value stay in its place or be inserted before the first value ?

### BigO
* best case    : O(n2) => Linear time
* worst case   : O(n2) => Quadratic time
* average case : O(n2) => Quadratic time

### Spatial complexity: O(1)
We're operating on the array itself not creating anything else in memory
